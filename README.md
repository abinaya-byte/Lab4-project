# Fish-project

This project focuses on predicting the weight of a fish based on its physical measurements using a Machine Learning model (XGBoost Regressor). The model is integrated into a Flask API that allows users to input fish measurements through a web interface and get real-time predictions.

The project is designed to be lightweight, user-friendly, and deployable on Heroku so that anyone can access the prediction service online.
